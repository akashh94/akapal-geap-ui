## 1. System Architecture Flow

The workspace coordinates user queries, application state, local tool executions, and external LLM connections. Below is the system flow map:

## 2. Technical Stack

The proof of concept is constructed as a modern, framework-free single-page web application designed for low latency, zero build step overhead, and ease of audit.

### Backend (Node.js & Express)
* **Runtime**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) utilizing [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to serve static assets and handle routing fallback for deep linking.
* **Session Management**: `express-session` handles server-side user sessions and connects OAuth access tokens to unique browser sessions.
* **Authentication**: Out-of-band OAuth 1.0a flow connecting to the **E\*TRADE Developer API Sandbox** (using `oauth-1.0a` and `crypto` for HMAC-SHA1 signature calculations).
* **Search Proxy**: Proxies query calls to Google News RSS feeds (`/api/search`) to bypass CORS and serve live articles from Bloomberg, Reuters, Morningstar, and Yahoo Finance in JSON format.
* **CSS Minifier**: Native startup logic in [server.js](../server.js) that scans the stylesheet folder on start and minifies raw files into `.min.css` dynamically.
* **Audit Logs**: Redirects `console.log` and `console.error` to a persistent local `server.log` file.

### Frontend (Vanilla JS SPA)
* **Single Page Shell**: Framework-free rendering in [index.html](../public/index.html) controlled by [app.js](../public/js/app.js).
* **Navigation Router**: vanilla JavaScript router mapping path hooks to dedicated module renderers (preserving the app shell headers and side rails).
* **Chart Rendering**: Fully custom inline SVG generators and canvas layouts (e.g. sparklines, donut distribution allocation grids, retirement projection curves).
* **Theme Styling**: Clean HSL custom CSS system featuring modern typographic scales, responsive layouts, micro-animations, glassmorphism overlays, and a dark mode aesthetic tailored to the E\*TRADE look and feel.

## 3. Core Modules & Engine Components

The functionality is split across modular client-side engines:

### A. Unified Context Engine ([context.js](../public/js/context.js))
Dynamically constructs JSON/Markdown payload representations of the application state for each agent request:
1. **Platform Details**: Active route, system timestamp, visual theme.
2. **User Profiles**: Account name, last login timestamp.
3. **Selected Account Context**: Account ID, net asset value, settled buying power cash.
4. **Security Governance**: Boolean status of PII scrubbing, safety overrides, and disclaimer toggles.
5. **AI Source Policies**: Allowed public/private source whitelists (`yahoo`, `sec`, `bloomberg`, `reuters`, `morningstar`, `private_holdings`, `private_transactions`, `private_tax`) and access level permissions (e.g., Read-Only vs Read-Write).

### B. Gemini API Integration ([gemini.js](../public/js/gemini.js))
Direct connector to Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (`gemini-3.5-flash`):
1. **Dynamic Import**: Loads the official `@google/genai` SDK from `esm.run` at runtime when an API key is entered.
2. **Streaming Execution**: Initiates stream content chunks using `ai.models.generateContentStream` to stream text responses to the UI in real time.
3. **Recursive Tool Calling**: Declares function definitions and recursively resolves `functionCall` objects by executing local JS tools and pushing responses back into the prompt stream context.

### C. Multi-Agent Fleet Manager ([agents.js](../public/js/agents.js))
Houses configurations, system instructions, tool bounds, and routing behaviors. It defines 6 specialized agents:

1. **Portfolio Analyst**: Evaluates holdings, weights, diversification, rebalancing opportunities, and tax-loss harvesting candidates.
2. **Trade Assistant**: Guides order types, stock quotes, margins, position sizing risk warnings.
3. **Market Research**: Explains economic metrics, S&P trends, equity bull/bear outlooks.
4. **Customer Support**: Handles platform navigation tutorials, account transfers, fees, tax document retrieval FAQ paths.
5. **Market Research Super Agent**: Advanced analyst utilizing Morgan Stanley Research, crypto/ETFs, commodities (gold), and private equity.
6. **Mortgage Agent**: Guides Jumbo loan guidelines (MS Jumbo vs Rocket partner referral limits), HELOC eligibility, location/timeline inputs.

#### Intent Routing Engine (`autoRoute`)
Analyzes query text using score metrics:
* **Keyword Density**: Scores matches against core lists (e.g., "rebalance" -> Portfolio, "limit order" -> Trade).
* **Page Route Bias**: Shifts routing weight depending on the SPA page the user is viewing (e.g. browsing `/trading` tilts auto-routing toward the Trade Assistant).
* **Model Configuration**: Exposes dynamic interfaces for custom agent creation (`registerAgent`) and decommissioning (`deregisterAgent`) at runtime.

## 5. Security, Privacy & Compliance Guardrails

The platform embeds multi-layered compliance guardrails directly into the transaction processing pipeline:

### A. Privacy Shield (PII Scrubber)
Intercepts user queries client-side before sending data to the LLM. It scans for patterns matching:
* **Social Security Numbers**: Redacted to `[REDACTED SSN]`.
* **Account Numbers**: Redacted to `[REDACTED ACCOUNT]`.
* **Email Addresses**: Redacted to `[REDACTED EMAIL]`.
* **Phone Numbers**: Redacted to `[REDACTED PHONE]`.
A diagnostic message is added to the UI chat stream whenever PII is scrubbed.

### B. Content Safety Gate
Blocks prompt injections, jailbreaks, and system override instructions (`"ignore prior instructions"`, `"override prompt"`) when the Content Safety rule is enabled in the Agent Fabric toggles.

### C. Fiduciary Disclosures
Checks responses for investment terminology (e.g. portfolio, stock, shares, rebalance). If detected, it automatically appends a Morgan Stanley Smith Barney SIPC investment risk disclaimer.

### D. UTMA Custodial Protections
Identifies the active account context. If the user is viewing the UTMA minor custodial account:
* Outbound cash transfers and asset withdrawal tools are blocked.
* System returns UTMA compliance warnings noting that UTMA cash belongs irrevocably to the minor.
* Suggests human compliance officer review paths.

### E. Human Handoff / High-Risk Guardrails
Wire transfers or large outbound transactions (e.g., withdrawals above $10,000) are flagged as high risk. The agent:
1. Blocks automatic execution.
2. Stages a draft transfer.
3. Generates a mock callback ticket (e.g., `MS-WIRE-84920`).
4. Directs the user to human wire desk support hotlines.

## 6. Verification and Unit Testing

The project maintains a full suite of automated verification suites under [tests](../tests):
* **Unit Tests**: Coverage for agent auto-routing, transaction data processing, and context engine formatting.
* **Integration Tests**: Tests the Express backend APIs (session saving, proxy news RSS scraping, auth pathways).
* **End-to-End Tests**: Puppeteer script validation simulating chat message runs, checking PII scrubbing compliance, and validating route redirection.
